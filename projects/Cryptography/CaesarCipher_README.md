# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher (also known as a shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift) is one of the oldest and most famous ciphers in history.
The Caesar cipher is named after the legendary Roman emperor Julius Caesar, who used it to protect his military communications.
It is a simple substitution cipher, where each letter corresponds to another letter a certain number of positions forward or backward in the alphabet.
For example, a shift right of 5 would encode the word Caesar as “hfjxfw”.
Due to this simplicity, the Caesar cipher offers little security against those with even a passing knowledge of cryptography.
