#Off-Platform Project: Coded Correspondence
#Project overview:
#In this off-platform project, you will be exchanging coded communications with your pen pal, Vishal.
#The two of you challenge each other by sending coded messages that you will have to use your Python skills to decipher!
#Put your programming skills to the test with these fun cryptography puzzles.
#
#You and your pen pal, Vishal, have been exchanging letters for some time now.
#Recently, he has become interested in cryptography and the two of you have started sending encoded messages within your letters.
#In this project, you will use your Python skills to decipher the messages you receive and to encode your own responses!
#Put your programming skills to the test with these fun cryptography puzzles.
#Here is his most recent letter:
# - Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a Caesar Cipher.
# - Here's how it works: You take your message, something like "hello" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. 
# - For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of "hello", I would encode my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left with respect to the alphabet.
# - So "h" becomes "e", "e" becomes "b", "l" becomes "i", and "o" becomes "l". Then I have my encoded message, "ebiil"!
# - Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it by shifting each letter 3 places to the right.
# - The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool!
# - Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer encoded message that you have to decode yourself!
# - xuo jxuhu! jxyi yi qd unqcfbu ev q squiqh syfxuh. muhu oek qrbu je tusetu yj? y xefu ie! iudt cu q cuiiqwu rqsa myjx jxu iqcu evviuj!
# - This message has an offset of 10. Can you decode it?
