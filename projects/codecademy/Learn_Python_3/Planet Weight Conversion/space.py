#Project overview:
#Little Codey is an interplanetary space boxer who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.
#Write a space.py program that helps Codey keep track of their target weight by:
#1. Checking which number planet is equal to.
#2. Computing Codeyâ€™s weight on the destination planet.


print("I have information for the following planets:\n")

print("   1. Venus   2. Mars    3. Jupiter")
print("   4. Saturn  5. Uranus  6. Neptune\n")
 
weight = 185
planet = 3

# Write an if statement below:
if planet == 1:
  weight = weight * 0.91
elif planet == 2:
  weight = weight * 0.38
elif planet == 3:
  weight = weight * 2.34
elif planet == 4:
  weight = weight * 1.06
elif planet == 5:
  weight = weight * 0.92
elif planet == 6:
  weight = weight * 1.19
else:
  print("Error. Planet not found")

print(weight)
