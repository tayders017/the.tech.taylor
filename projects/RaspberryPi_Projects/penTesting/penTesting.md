# Practicing ethical hacking and penetration techniques with Raspberry Pi.

## Goals of practice
* Configure portable headless ethical hacking device with rapsberry pi.
* Allow remote unlock for pi.
* Enable LUKS Nuke.
* 

## Steps taken
1. First, download and install Kali Linux <site link: https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-3/>.
* Using a Raspberry Pi 3.
* Make sure the ISO is bootable: <site link: https://www.kali.org/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/>

2. After Kali Linux is installed on pi, run through the initial setup.
* Reset default password.
* Enable SSH. (*was enabled by default.)
  * and/or check if SSH is enabled. <site link: https://linuxhint.com/check-if-ssh-is-running-on-linux/>
* Run updates & upgrades. <site link: https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/>
* Kernel info. <site link: https://www.kali.org/blog/secure-kali-raspberry-pi/>
* ETC...
  
3. Establish connection to Kali via SSH from laptop to utilize CLI.

4. Upgrade Kali Linux install to include everything.
* Run cmd to install all tools. <site link: https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/ && https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/>
* Reference for config help if needed. <site link: https://linuxconfig.org/intrusion-detection-systems-using-tripwire-on-linux>

5. Run update && upgrade again to ensure everything is up-to-date.

6. Add additional "user" to Kali Linux.
* <site link: >

7. Set static IP address.
* Get IP address and router IP (aka. default gateway).
* Update interfaces file, add wlan0 config info.
* Link to a site with more info on IP addressing <site link: https://routersecurity.org/ipaddresses.php>

## Tweaks I made during the 
* <site link: https://installati.one/install-timeshift-kalilinux/>

## All commands used during setup/config and testing - with description of what each was used for
* ifconfig
  * Use to gather network connectivity info. (ie. broadcasting IP, etc.)
* ping <website-URL> [example: ping google.com]
  * Use to test access to internet.
* clear
  * Use to clear screen.
* ssh <kali-linux-username>@<kali-linux-IP> [example: ssh kali-root-user@127.0.0.1]
  * Use to test if ssh is established w/kali instance.
* sudo apt update
  * Use to update kali linux repositories to latest version.
* sudo apt upgrade
  * Use to upgrade kali linux.
  * and: sudo apt full-upgrade -y
  	* -y selects yes for all prompts.
  * and: sudo apt install -y kali-linux-everything <site link: https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/>
* apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 7D8D0BF6
  * Didn't use.
  * May need to use if following steps from video lessons on EC-Counsil for "Enabling SSH (Secure Shell) on Raspberry Pi". 
* service ssh status
  * Use to check ssh status.
  * Can use <restart> and <stop> in place of <status> to restart/stop as needed. 
* ip r
  * Use to check default gateway (routers IP).
* ip addr
	* Use to check interfaces for IP address.
* df -h
  * Use to check disk space. 
* cd /<directory>
  * Use to move to different directory. 
* ls
  * Use to list contents of directory. 
* dpkg
  * Use to depackage  
* adduser <username>
  * Use to add new user.
* sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
  * Use this to review the network interfaces configuration file.
* startx
	* Use to start X Window System.

##
* Unable to manage default video settings. (ie. had to select "CC" for every single video or "lesson", should either save the last chosen selection or allow to set defaults.)
* Closed captions are also poorly dictated. (ie. "raspberry pi" appeared as "bye-bye", amongst a slew of other incorrect dications.)
